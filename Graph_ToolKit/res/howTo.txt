How to use :
==============================================>

A. Vertex Controls:
=====================>
	1. Adding a vertex: 
		Use "Add a Vertex" button of the side control panel to create a vertex 
	   	with appropriate numbering.
	2. Delete a vertex: 
		Use "Delete a Vertex" button of the side control panel to delete the 
	   	last added vertex.

B. Edge Controls:
=====================>
	1. Adding an edge: 
		Locate Edge_Controls in the side control panel. Enter the name of two vertices properly
	   	between which the edge is to be added. Then press Add.
	   	To create weighted edges enter corresponding weight in the textbox weight, before pressing Add.
	2. Deleting and edge: 
		In the Edge_Controls section find "Delete_edge_between" and insert the name of the
	   	vertices where the edge is to be deleted.

	   N.B:	If you do not mention any weight while adding an edge, the default weight will be 1.
		Name of the vertices should be entered properly. If you are using numbers then enter numbers or if
		you are using alphabets then insert corresponding alphabets in eighter upper or lower case.
		Otherwise the edge will not be added. The same goes for deleting an edge.
		The order of names is important while working with directed graphs. In that case edges will be 
		added in the order you enter vertices names.
