# Graph_ToolKit
This is made with C++ using sfml and win32 api and it is a complete tool kit to work with graphs.<br>
All kinds of graph operations are supported with every type of graph, with lots of customisation options. <br>
There are tools for visualisation of BFS and DFS algorithm on graphs you create. 
You can even save your current graph as adjacent matrix and load it later. Directly create any graph just by using adjacent matrix.<br><br>

<h3>Create new graphs, work with it, add vertices and edges easily</h3>


<h3>Change your graph settings as per need. </h3>


<h3>You can also customize every single property of your graph.</h3>
