How to use :
==============================================>

Basic Operations :
===================>
    The basic operations like adding a vertex, deleting a vertex, adding an edge, deleting an edge all of them can 
    be done from the contol panel present on the right side of the window. And they are pretty much self explanatory,
    so I am not going to explain those.

    But there are a few points to remember:
    =======================================
	1. Adding or deleting a vertex will be performed preserving the ordering or naming of the vertices. Deleting 
	   a vertex will delete the last added vertex. Name of the vertices should be entered properly. If you are 
	   using numbers then enter numbers or if you are using alphabets then insert corresponding alphabets in 
	   eighter upper or lower case.

	2. While adding an edge if you do not mention any weight, the default weight will be 1.
	   The order of names is important while working with directed graphs. In that case edges will be added in
	   the order you enter vertices names.


Graph Settings:
=================>
    On the right panel there is a button called "Settings". This is where you can change your graph setting.
    There are 4 options: 
	1. Weighted : If this is turned on, you can see the weights for each corresponding edge of the graph.

	2. Directed : If this is turned on, you can see the directions of each edge. This is for working with 
	   	directed graphs.

	3. Start From Zero : Turning on this option makes the first vertex number as 0. Otherwise it is 1. This
	   	indicates the number or name of the first vertex you add.

	4. Use Alphabets : Turning on this option allows you to have Alphabetical names for your vertices.
	   	Naming will start from A in this case.


Saving and Loading:
====================>
    Graphs you create can be saved as adjacent matrices. Similarly graphs can be created by using adjacent
    matrices too. Navigate to "File" menu on top, there will be 2 options

	1. Load : This is to be used when you need to load a graph from it's adjacent matrix. The adjacent matrix 
		is to be stored in "input.txt" file present in the same directory.
		N.B. You must mention the number of vertices on the first line before adjacent matrix

	2. Save : Using this the current graph on the canvas can be saved as an adjacent matrix. This will be 
	   	saved in "output.txt" file present in the same directory.

	N.B. Both "input.txt" and "output.txt" files contain a sample adjacent matrix for reference. Enter your 
		custom inputs according to the format of the samples.


Editor Options:
================>
    Navigate to "Tools" menu on top, there is another menu item called "Editor Options". This section allows you to 
    customize your graph visually. Change how your graph looks. There are several options present like changing the 
    color of vertices, edges, texts and changing the size of them. Find the theme you like.


Visualization Settings:
========================>
    Navigate to "Visualizations" menu on topThis is the most fun part. This enables you to visualize some 
    graph algorithms on the graph you have created. What the options do - 

	1. View Adjacent Matrix : This allows you to see the adjacent matrix of the current graph that is present 
		on the canvas.

	2. Visualize BFS : As the name suggests you can visualize BFS algorithm on the current graph.

	3. Visualize DFS : Visualize DFS algorithm on the current graph.

	4. Find Shortest Path : With this you can visualize the shortest path that is present between any two 
		vertices of the current graph. A prompt will appear asking for source and destination vertex, 
		enter the names and click apply.

	5. Settings : Here you can change the animation speed of the visualizations. Also the color of the 
		vertices during visualization.
